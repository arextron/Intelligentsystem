NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It's a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with the interaction between computers and humans in natural language. NLP helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language, allowing them to process and analyze vast amounts of text data.

Some common applications of NLP include:

1. Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing text to determine the sentiment or emotional tone behind it (positive, negative, neutral).
2. Language Translation: Translating text from one language to another.
3. Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined categories (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails).
4. Named Entity Recognition: Identifying specific entities like names, locations, and organizations within text.
5. Speech Recognition: Recognizing spoken language and transcribing it into text.

NLP has many practical uses in various industries, such as customer service chatbots, language translation software, and content analysis tools.
